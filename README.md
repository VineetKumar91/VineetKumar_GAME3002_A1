 Game Physics Engines Assignment 1 - Soccer Penalty Shootout 2 Player
 
 Unity Version used - **2020.2.0f1**
 
 This is a small demo of Soccer Penalty shoot-out. There is a build inside the folder to launch the game directly for testing.
 - When the game starts, the PlayScene will be directly presented making 'Player 1' as the default starter of the game (refer Top right part of the screen).
 - There are instructions of controls on the left up corner of the screen to make it easier for both the players to understand the controls.
 - First you have to use Mouse X-axis movement to adjust the horizontal direction.
 - Note, there is a small line trajectory that helps in determining where the ball can head off to if that angle is used.
 - The red colored arrow in front of the ball indicates the direction. Once the Player has pressed the Left Mouse Button to lock the horizontal axis, the Arrow will turn green.
 - The Player has to then set the vertical direction for the kick along with force (both can be done simulatanously)
 - The Mouse wheel can be used to set the vertical direction scrolling upwards for increase in height and downwards for decrease in height
 - The Spacebar can be used to set the force of kick.
 - Hold spacebar to charge the shot and **Release SPACEBAR will TRIGGER the KICK**.
 - When the ball lands on the goal's net, the player will successfully score a goal or if it lands anywhere else the player will miss that penalty.
 - Appropriate SFX and UI will be updated when either of these happen.
 - The UI on top-right will be updated with green or red color to determine which penalty kick (number) is going on.
 - Finish off the 5 turns of each player to conclude the game and trigger the EndScene and decide the winner. There can also be a tie if both scores are same.
 - **The game will exit on its own at the EndScene**
 - Press 'R' to reset the game. Press 'Esc' to quit the game.
